# Export Formats

Reports can be exported from any completed investigation via:

```
GET /api/report/{id}/export?format=<format>
```

or via the **Export** button in the web UI.

All exports are returned as file downloads with a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header.

**Filename pattern:** `mailaccess_{email}_{investigation_id}.{ext}`
